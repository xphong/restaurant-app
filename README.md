Restaurant Menu using JSP

Old project - uploaded for reference

## Description
A customer is able to select a list of food and then checks out the order: 

Items on the list with their prices are retrieved from a file. Every item is an object of a class type that can accept the name of the item and its price.

The Servlet processes the request and sends a response back to the user. The response contains a list of orders along with the prices and the total price. On this page a user can change the quantity of each selected food. 

Based on that, the total price should be calculated if the user press a refresh bottom. A “confirm” button finalizes the order. Upon completion, returns a list (like the confirmation list with an appropriate message) to the user.
